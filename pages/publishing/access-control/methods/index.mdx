# Distributed Key Management

In Verify all content must be publicly accessible, but some licenses require the asset to not be public.

For this, a distributed key management protocol can be used to store assets in an encrypted fashion. 
Allowing users to decrypt the content by gaining access to the symmetric key used to encrypt through satisfy the asset nodes license.

Other distributed key management protocols may be support in the future, but each will require a formalization of the schema
to be included in the access field of asset/collection nodes. 

All methods of providing access to content must make use of the common interface of `IAuthorization(address authModule).auth(bytes32 id, address user)`


Feel free to reach out if a key management protocol you wish to use is not supported.
