# Data Storage

All files, metadata and raw assets, published to VERIFY must be stored at a publicly accessible location (IPFS / ARWEAVE / S3). IPFS and ARWEAVE are recommended however it
is ultimately up to the publisher.

## Metadata

All metadata is stored as utf-8 json

## Asset Data

Asset data is stored in a form that corresponds to the defined MIME type in the corresponding metadata file. Asset data can be encrypted but should be accessible from access method
specified in the metadata file.

> See [licenses section](/publishing/access-control/) for more information on methods of access and how licenses work in VERIFY.
