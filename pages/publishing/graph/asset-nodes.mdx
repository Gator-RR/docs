# Asset Nodes

Asset nodes point at the metadata for an asset and function as their tokenized representation.

Asset nodes only exist as leafs in the content graph.

## Asset Nodes Ids

The unique id of an asset is calculated based on the content it represents. The unique identifier for a digital asset is generated by hashing the raw data with the [keccak256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) hashing algorithm. 
This creates a 256 bit/32 byte unique identifier. As asset nodes are unique there should only be one owner per digital asset. An existing asset can be redistributed through creating a reference node for the original asset.

```
Input: Hello World!
keccak256 Output: 0x3ea2f1d0abf3fc66cf29eebb70cbd4e7fe762ef8a09bcc06c8edf641230afec0
```

## Authorization

Authorization modules for both reference and access are set utilizing the `setAccessAuth()` and `setReferenceAuth()` methods.
Providing auth to a user at the asset level means that all users authorized here will have access/reference on all child content nodes.
If a user does not satisfy either, authorization will be delegated to parent org nodes modules.

## Asset Node Schema

### Felids 

* `data` contains all the associated metadata for an asset
* `signature` contains the signature param/values from signing the content in the data field
* `binding` contains a hash value from the asset

#### data

* `data.description` a textual description of the underlying content of the asset
* `data.encrypted` a boolean to describe the data state in the content locations
* `data.access` a key value list of params organized by method for accessing the content
* `data.content` a list of locations of the content and the corresponding encoding
* `data.content[i].location` a uri where the content is accessible
* `data.content[i].type` the MIME type of the content
* `data.manifest` a extendable field where additional metadata can be stored and attested to by the signer
* `data.contentBinding.hash` the hash of the raw unencrypted content associated with the asset
* `data.contentBinding.algo` the algorithm used to hash the raw unencrypted content associated with the asset

##### access Methods & Schema

> See [licenses section](/publishing/access-control/) for more information on methods of access and how licenses work in VERIFY.

#### signature

* `signature.curve` the elliptic curve used to sign the content of the data field
* `signature.signature` the produced signature from signing the message
* `signature.message` the keccak256 hash of the content in the data field
* `signature.description` a textual description of the method used to generate the signature
