# The Content Graph

The content graph is based on the [ERC6150](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6150) standard for hierarchical NFTs. This hierarchical
structure allows for inheritance of parent licenses from children.

There are three types of tokens/nodes that exist in the graph.

- **Organization Nodes**: Used to manage the organization of content.
- **Reference Nodes**: A reference to an asset node, owned by another publisher.
- **Asset nodes**: Nodes which abstractly represent a digital asset.

The root of the graph (id: 0) is unowned. Allowing any publisher registered through the identity registry of Verify to create nodes as children.

These node types allow content published to Verify to have multiple patterns of auth/ownership, based on the publishers organizational
and content licensing needs.

## Organization (Org) Nodes

Org nodes do not directly reference content. Their purpose is to organize content represented by reference and asset nodes. Allowing for all children of the org node
to inherit the access or reference license specified at that level.

Direct child nodes of the org node may also be org nodes.

**Owners of org nodes have the ability to**

- Create new child nodes (of any type)
- Delete child nodes (of any type)
- Edit child nodes (of any type)
- Set access or reference licenses for the org node or any children.
- Transfer the or any child token to other identities.

## Reference Nodes

Reference nodes represent a reference to an existing asset node. They are useful in redistributing assets that are not owned under another publisher.

Each reference nodes specifies a referenceOf. The value of the referenceOf is the id which this node is referencing. In order to create a 
reference node the creator must satisfy the referenced asset node reference license.

> Reference nodes do not have any child nodes and can only exist as leafs in the graph. They also cannot be referenced by other nodes in the graph.

**Owners of collection nodes have the ability to**

- Set access modules for the reference node.
- Delete the reference node.
- Transfer the node to other identities or move between owned parents.

In order to access a reference node through the `auth()` method. The user calling must satisfy the access authorization set by the creator as well as
the creator satisfying the reference authorization module set on the asset node it references.

## Asset Nodes

Abstractly represents a digital asset. Ownership of this node/token represents the ownership of the underlying asset.

> Asset nodes do not have any child nodes and can only exist as leafs in the graph.

**Owners of asset nodes have the ability to:**

- The ability to set metadata associated with the asset
- The ability to set reference and access modules.
- Transfer the node to other identities or move between owned parents.
