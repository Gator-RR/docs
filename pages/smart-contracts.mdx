# Smart contracts

The two application contracts of VERIFY are the [IdentityRegistry.sol](/publishing/identity/contract/) and [ContentGraph.sol](/publishing/graph/contract/).

Both make use of Openzeppelin's [TransparentUpgradeableProxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy) pattern.

There are three sets of these contracts currently deployed:

* **Testnet**: Where real world entities are registered and content is being signed and published in a Testnet environment. Registration with the protocol required.
* **Sandbox**: Where developers can play around with and test the protocol. No named entities or registration of identities with the protocol.
* **Alpha**: An early stage, soon to be depricated, content graph smart contract. This was deployed as part of the testing and development of the protocol. Now being used from some early application
developers.

> Both Testnet and Sandbox environments are on the VERIFY testnet, a Polygon cdk validum appchain. For links to the RPC, Bridge, and Blockexplorer can be found [here](https://raas.gelato.network/rollups/details/public/verify-testnet).
