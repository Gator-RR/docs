# Why build this?


Over the past few decades, the internet, social media, and now AI has changed the way we consume content.


For example, the way we consume news has changed, but generally the way we produce news has not. It's become hard to know what's real in the new social era of our online lives.

People are increasingly relying on creators and influencers to help them navigate social platforms, but this is not a sustainable solution, as the rise in generative content and deep fakes means that it will become increasingly difficult to know if content is authentic.

An increasing number of consumers will also turn to more personalized and curated applications which are built on generative models. While there are tons of exciting possibilities, there are also many risks as these models are prone to hallucinate and take things out of context when summarizing and creating derivatives of content.

We don't believe big media companies should be the sole arbiters of truth, but do respect publishers who stand behind the stories they print.

While we started with news content, the journey doesn’t stop there. But here are some of our foundational beliefs:

- We believe in the power of strong journalism. Backing up our claims with evidence.
- We believe that the future of news is a decentralized one, where the public can contribute and verify more elements of news content for themselves.
- We believe that the rights of journalists, writers, photographers and publishers should be protected, and that they should be rewarded for their work. Specifically with the increase in generative content, where models are trained upon and search a large corpus of content.

This is our first effort to build such a system. A system that addresses these considerations and allows for IP creators and owners to benefit and protect from downstream syndication.

- Provenance is a key component of the “value” of content or data.
- The modern web does not support the provenance of content or IP/licensing of that product. Original sources are lost.
- Data and original content is more valuable as demand for use in model training has been increasing.
- The sea of content is growing exponentially, making content without provenance less valuable and that with more valuable.
