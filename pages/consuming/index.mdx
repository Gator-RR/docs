# Consuming

All data but some digital assets in Verify are publicly available. Here we will walk through methods of indexing and reading this information.

In the near future an API as well as a SDK will make performing reads in Verify much easier.

## Identity

Its important to known who is publishing what on Verify. To identify the publisher of a piece of content the following can be done.

Given a id of a token in the graph a user can first get the metadata surrounding a token:

`ContentGraph.getNode(id)`

This method returns a tuple of the following, where a uri that corresponds to a metadata file location for the node.

```solidity
struct Node {
    uint256 token;
    NodeType nodeType;
    bytes32 id;
    bytes32 referenceOf;
    string uri;
    address accessAuth;
    address referenceAuth;
}
```

The metadata file will contain attestations to the publisher of the content as well as two signatures. One is the identity
signature stored under the data field. The other is a signature from the transacting wallet.

Both of these signatures can be used to recover the root identity and intermediate identity (see [identity](/publishing/identity)).

The public keys recovered can be converted into their corresponding addresses by taking the keccak256 hash of the key
and keeping the 20 right most bytes.

```
intermediateAddress: 0x3209FA...
rootAddress: 0xAC38901...
```

To check if the intermediate identity is registered to the root, you can use the [`whoIs()`](/publishing/identity/contract) method of the identity
registry contract. If the `intermediateAddress` is registered `whoIs()` will return the `rootAddress`, else the 0 address will be returned.

To get the name associated to the `rootAddress` the `rootName()` mapping can be used to recover the name that is registered by the protocol to that
root address.

If all signatures are valid and recover to the expected values, then the values of the metadata file have been attested to by the root identity recovered.

## ContentGraph

To index over the tokens in the graph the `childrenOf()` and `parentOf()` methods can be used. As all nodes share a common parent id: 0, the tree can be indexed
by starting at the root and using the childrenOf() method to get the list of child nodes. To traverse up from a leaf node the `parentOf()` method can be used to
get the single parent of a child node.

As the content graph is based on [ERC6150](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6150) which is based on [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) , traditional methods of token ownership indexing can be used.
